# I've Moved!

My new GitHub profile can be found at **[github.com/jmshrv](https://github.com/jmshrv)**.

## Why?

I've used UnicornsOnLSD for everything since I was about 12, so I naturally used it for my GitHub in 2016 (see note). Back then, I didn't need to care about presenting my profile in a professional capacity, but as that need arised the nature of the username has always stuck in the back of my head. What would an employer think when they saw UnicornsOnLSD at the top of my CV? I used to shrug it off with the excuse of "well I wouldn't want to work for a company that's that dull anyway", but that's not how the world works.

I'm also growing a bit tired of UnicornsOnLSD. It's just a bit... childish? It's only a username, but I don't think it really suits me anymore. I may phase it out futher where it makes sense.

**TL;DR**: Professionalism, and the username is getting old at this point.

### Account Creation Date Note

I deleted my account and moved to GitLab for a bit during the Microsoft acquisition, but moved back in 2018.
